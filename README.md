# Python-Variables-
Variables  One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.  An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:  >>> message = 'And now for something completely different' >>> n = 17 >>> pi = 3.1415926535897931 This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named message; the second assigns the integer 17 to n; the third assigns the (approximate) value of Ï€ to pi. To display the value of a variable, you can use a print statement: >>> print(n) 17 >>> print(pi) 3.141592653589793 The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to. >>> type(message) &lt;class 'str'> >>> type(n) &lt;class 'int'> >>> type(pi) &lt;class 'float'>
